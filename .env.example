# AI Provider API Keys
# These are optional - you can use the app in demo mode without them
# Get your API keys from:
# - OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# - Anthropic: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
# - Google AI: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

# Note: API keys are not stored on the server
# They are entered directly in the UI and used client-side only
# This file is just for reference if you want to pre-configure them
